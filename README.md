This repository demonstrates a common Perl bug related to comparing undef values using the 'eq' operator. The bug.pl file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.pl provides the corrected version.  The issue arises because 'undef' is not a string, leading to unexpected behavior and warnings.  The solution shows how to correctly handle undef values when performing string comparisons.
